                <h3>Student Internship on Browser Security</h3>
                <p>NITK Surathkal | August 2023 - September 2023</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>During my internship, one of the key areas of focus was experimenting with the OpenSSL tool, a widely used software library for secure communication and cryptography. I worked on a small project where I applied OpenSSL to match hash functions of files and web pages. This process involved fetching the web page using specific commands and then comparing the hash values. If the hash of the file or webpage matched the expected result, users were granted access to the webpage. This task helped me understand the practical application of cryptographic hashing and its role in verifying the integrity of data.</li>
                    <li>In addition to my  work with OpenSSL, I also delved into understanding how web browsers function, gaining insights into the core components and the overall architecture of browsers. This included learning how browsers process, render, and display web pages, and how they handle communication with web servers. This knowledge of browser functionality provided a strong foundation for more advanced tasks, particularly in the realm of browser-based cryptography.</li>
                    <li>Building on this understanding, I attempted to develop a hash-matching algorithm within the browser itself. Although the final output didn't meet my expectations, the process allowed me to deepen my knowledge of both cryptography and browser internals. The challenges I encountered during this project were valuable learning experiences, giving me the confidence and skills to tackle similar tasks in the future with a better grasp of both the technical tools and browser-based algorithms.</li>

                <h3>Student Internship on Cyber Security</h3>
                <p><b>EyeQ Dot Net | June 2024 - July 2024</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>During the internship, I explored various topics related to web application security, focusing on OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) guidelines, which highlight the top vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure deserialization. These topics provided a foundation for understanding the most common and critical security flaws found in web applications. Additionally, TryHackMe courses introduced practical exercises for cybersecurity, offering hands-on labs to strengthen your skills in detecting and mitigating vulnerabilities in real-world scenarios.</li>
                    <li>Burp Suite, a professional tool for penetration testing, was a key focus. Using its powerful features, I captured HTTP requests, altered them, and sent them back to the server to test how changes in the requests could potentially exploit vulnerabilities. This allowed me to understand how attackers might manipulate data and probe for weaknesses in web applications. I also learned how to use Burp Suite for automated scanning, analyzing traffic, and testing for security misconfigurations.</li>
                    <li>Other techniques, such as Google Dorking, were covered, helping me to refine search queries to locate sensitive information that might be unintentionally exposed online. The combination of theoretical knowledge and practical assignments allowed me to develop a strong grasp of vulnerability detection and reporting, aligning my skills with industry standards in web application security.</li>

                <h3>IT support Training and Internship</h3>
                <p>Fuel | September 2024 - October 2024</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>During my internship, I received extensive training in Java programming, with a particular focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. I also learned how to use JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to establish connections between Java applications and databases, allowing me to interact with and manipulate data effectively. This training provided a solid foundation for building robust, scalable applications using Java, enhancing my understanding of both programming logic and data management.</li>
                    <li>In addition to technical skills, the internship also covered aptitude sessions and employability skills, preparing me for real-world job scenarios. I complemented my training by completing several Java-related courses offered through LinkedIn, expanding my knowledge in areas like advanced Java programming, design patterns, and best practices. These combined experiences not only strengthened my coding abilities but also equipped me with essential problem-solving and professional skills.</li>
